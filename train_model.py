# Trains and evaluates a Linear Regression model to predict Initial Margin for futures trading.

def train_model(input_file="risk_data.csv"):

    # The Purpose of doing these are as follows:

    - The Initial Margin is a required deposit for trading futures contracts.
    - Here we use **historical data** to predict future Initial Margin requirements.
    - A reliable model helps in *risk management* and *capital allocation*.

    # Methodology 

    1. **Load Data**:
       - Reads the processed risk data from `risk_data.csv`.
       - Selects relevant features for margin prediction.
    
    2. **Feature Selection**:
       - Uses **Close Price** and **Volatility** as predictor variables.
       - Sets **Initial Margin** as the target variable.

    3. **Data Preprocessing**:
       - Splits data into **Training (80%)** and **Test (20%)** sets.
       - Applies **StandardScaler** to normalize feature values.

    4. **Model Training**:
       - Trains a **Linear Regression model** on the training data.

    5. **Model Evaluation**:
       - It computes **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** which measures the average squared error.
       - It computes **RÂ² Score** which indicates how well the model explains variance in Initial Margin.
       - It prints the evaluation metrics.


    # Parameters
    input_file(str): Path to the input CSV file containing risk data.

    # Returns
    - None (It displays model performance metrics).
