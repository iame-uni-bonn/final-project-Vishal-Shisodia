# Trains and evaluates a Random Forest model to predict Initial Margin for futures trading.

def train_model(input_file="risk_data.csv"):

    # Purpose of This Model:

    - **Initial Margin** is a required deposit for trading futures contracts.
    - This model uses **historical data** to predict future Initial Margin requirements.
    - A reliable prediction model helps in *risk management* and *capital allocation*.

    # Why Use Random Forest Instead of Linear Regression?

    - Non-linearity: Initial Margin is influenced by complex, non-linear factors such as volatility and Value at Risk (VaR), which Linear Regression cannot capture well.
    - Better Accuracy: Random Forest averages multiple Decision Trees, reducing variance and improving prediction accuracy.
    - Feature Importance: It helps identify which financial indicators impact Initial Margin the most.
    - Robustness: Handles outliers and missing data better than Linear Regression.

    # Methodology 

    1. **Load Data**:
       - Reads the processed risk data from `risk_data.csv`.
       - Selects relevant features for margin prediction.
    
    2. **Feature Engineering**:
       - Uses **Close Price**, **Volatility**, **5-day rolling averages**, and **VaR metrics**.
       - Computes **relative change in Variation Margin** to account for recent fluctuations.
       
    3. **Data Preprocessing**:
       - Splits data into **Training (80%)** and **Test (20%)** sets.
       - Applies **StandardScaler** to normalize feature values for better model performance.

    4. **Model Training**:
       - Trains a **Random Forest Regressor** with 100 decision trees on the training data.

    5. **Model Evaluation**:
       - It computes **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** which measures the average squared difference between actual and predicted values.
       - It computes **RÂ² Score** which indicates how well the model explains the variance in Initial Margin.
       - It Prints the evaluation metrics.

    # Parameters
    input_file (str): Path to the input CSV file containing risk data.

    # Returns
    - None (It displays model performance metrics).
