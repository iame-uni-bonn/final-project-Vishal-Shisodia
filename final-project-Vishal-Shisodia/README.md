# Margin Calculation and Risk Analysis for Financial Derivatives

This project aims to develop a Python tool to calculate margin requirements and assess risk exposure for financial derivatives traded on an exchange. The tool is designed to simplify margining processes and provide basic risk metrics such as Value at Risk (VaR).  


# Motivation  

Margining plays a crucial role in financial markets by ensuring that traders maintain adequate collateral to cover potential losses. Given my experience as a working student at **X**, an energy company in the **Exchange, Clearing, and Marketing Operations** department, I have developed a deeper understanding of margin requirements and risk assessment. This exposure has inspired me to work on a computational tool that simplifies margin calculations and provides insights into risk exposure.  

The project aims to bridge the gap between theoretical finance concepts and practical implementation through **Python-based automation**.  

# Features

- Initial Margin Calculation: It Computes initial margin based on historical price data and volatility.  
- Variation Margin: It tracks daily profit/loss and adjusts variation margin dynamically.  
- Risk Analysis: Includes risk metrics like Value at Risk (VaR) for evaluating potential losses.  
- Visualization: It plots historical price trends, margin requirements, and risk metrics for better insights.

# Libraries used :-

The project utilizes the following Python libraries:  

# Data Processing & Computation 
1. pandas – For data manipulation, handling CSV files, computing rolling statistics, and filtering data.  
2. numpy– For mathematical operations, calculating volatility, profit/loss, and other numerical computations.  

# Financial Data Retrieval  
3. yfinance – For fetching historical financial data (e.g., natural gas futures price data from Yahoo Finance).  

# Statistical & Risk Analysis 
4. scipy – For statistical analysis, probability distributions, and optimization functions.  
5. statsmodels – For time series analysis and advanced statistical methods.  
6. scikit-learn – If machine learning or regression models are implemented for risk predictions.  
7. arch – For implementing **GARCH** models (if applicable for volatility modeling).  

# Visualization
8. matplotlib – For basic data visualization, including price trends, margin requirements, and risk metrics.
