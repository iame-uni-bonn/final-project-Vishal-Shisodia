# Topic for the Final Project

# "Margin Calculation and Risk Analysis for Financial Derivatives"

This project develops a Python tool to calculate margin requirements and assess risk exposure for financial derivatives traded on an exchange. The tool is designed to simplify margining processes and provide basic risk metrics such as Value at Risk (VaR).

# Features
- Initial Margin Calculation: Computes initial margin based on historical price data and volatility.
- Variation Margin: Tracks daily profit/loss and adjusts variation margin dynamically.
- Risk Analysis: Includes risk metrics like Value at Risk (VaR) for evaluating potential losses.
- Visualization: Plots historical price trends, margin requirements, and risk metrics for better insights.

# Libraries:

The following libraries will be used in this project:
# pandas
  - For data manipulation and analysis.
  - To handle CSV files, compute rolling statistics, and filter data.
# numpy:
  - For mathematical operations.
  - To calculate volatility, profit/loss, and other numerical computations.
# matplotlib:
  - For data visualization.
  - To plot historical price trends, margin requirements, and risk metrics.
# yfinance:
  - For fetching historical financial data.
  - To download natural gas futures price data directly from Yahoo Finance.
